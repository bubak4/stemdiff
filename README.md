# STEMDIFF package

* STEMDIFF is a Python package that converts 4D-STEM dataset to a single powder diffraction file.
* **Principle** of 4D-STEM method has been described in open-source publications:
  * Publication #1: Nanomaterials 11 (2021) 962.
    [https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040962](https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040962)
  * Publication #2: Nanomaterials, submitted.
* [Simple demo](docs/demo/todo.txt) shows the STEMDIFF processing of a small 4D-STEM dataset. 
* [Detailed description](docs/stemdiff/index.html) of all STEMDIFF modules and functions (auto-generated by pdoc).

## Brief history of STEMDIFF

* Version 1.0 = Matlab: just simple summation of 4D-dataset
* Version 2.0 = like v1.0 + post-processing in Jupyter
* Version 3.0 = Python scripts: summation + S-filtering
* Version 4.0 = Python package: summation + S-filtering + deconvolution
	- summation = summation of all 2D-diffractograms
	- S-filtering = sum only diffractograms with strong diffractions = high S
	- deconvolution = reduce the effect of primary beam spread
	  &rarr; better resolution 
* Version 4.2 = like v4.0 + a few important improvements, such as:
	- sum just the central region with the strongest diffractions - higher speed
	- 3 centering types: (0) geometry, (1) weight of 1st, (2) individual weights 
	- better definition of summation and centering parameters
	- better documentation strings + demo data + improved **master script**
