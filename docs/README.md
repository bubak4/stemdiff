STEMDIFF package
================

* STEMDIFF converts a 4D-STEM dataset to a single powder diffraction file.
* This conversion is a key part of our 4D-STEM/PNBD method, which was described in two publications:
	1. *Nanomaterials* 11 (2021) 962.
	   [https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040962](https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040962)
	2. *Materials* 14 (2021) 7550.
       [https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14247550](https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14247550)
* If you use STEMDIFF in your research, **please cite** the 2nd publication (or both :-). 

Quick start
-----------

* STEMDIFF is a user-friendly package for routine everyday use.
* It converts *easy-to-collect* 4D-STEM datasets to *easy-to-process* powder diffractograms.

Installation
------------

* WWW site: [https://pypi.org/project/stemdiff/](https://pypi.org/project/stemdiff/)
* Standard one-line installation: `pip install stemdiff`

Brief history
-------------

* Version 1.0 = Matlab: just simple summation of 4D-dataset
* Version 2.0 = like v1.0 + post-processing in Jupyter
* Version 3.0 = Python scripts: summation + S-filtering
	- summation = summation of all 2D-diffractograms
	- S-filtering = sum only diffractograms with strong diffractions = high S
* Version 4.0 = Python package: summation + S-filtering + deconvolution
	- deconvolution = reduce the effect of primary beam spread &rArr; better resolution 
* Version 4.2 = like v4.0 + a few important improvements, such as:
	- sum just the central region with the strongest diffractions &rArr; higher speed
	- 3 centering types: (0) geometry, (1) weight of 1st, (2) individual weights 
	- better definition of summation and centering parameters
	- better documentation strings + demo data + improved *master script*
