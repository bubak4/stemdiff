STEMDIFF package
================

* STEMDIFF converts a 4D-STEM dataset to a single powder diffraction file.
* This conversion is a key part of our 4D-STEM/PNBD method, which was described in two publications:
  * Publication #1: Nanomaterials 11 (2021) 962.
    [https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040962](https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11040962)
  * Publication #2: Nanomaterials, submitted.
* STEMDIFF is a user-friendly Python package focused on a simple everyday use.

Installation
------------

* WWW site: [https://pypi.org/project/stemdiff/](https://pypi.org/project/stemdiff/)
* Standard one-line installation: `pip install stemdiff`

Brief history
-------------

* Version 1.0 = Matlab: just simple summation of 4D-dataset
* Version 2.0 = like v1.0 + post-processing in Jupyter
* Version 3.0 = Python scripts: summation + S-filtering
  - summation = summation of all 2D-diffractograms
  - S-filtering = sum only diffractograms with strong diffractions = high S
* Version 4.0 = Python package: summation + S-filtering + deconvolution
  - deconvolution = reduce the effect of primary beam spread &rArr; better resolution 
* Version 4.2 = like v4.0 + a few important improvements, such as:
  - sum just the central region with the strongest diffractions - higher speed
  - 3 centering types: (0) geometry, (1) weight of 1st, (2) individual weights 
  - better definition of summation and centering parameters
  - better documentation strings + demo data + improved **master script**
